# Sudoku Solver Web Application

A React-based web application that allows users to solve Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. The application provides an interactive interface for inputting puzzles, validates the input, and can solve valid Sudoku configurations.

## Features

- Interactive 9x9 grid for puzzle input
- Real-time input validation
- Puzzle solving using backtracking algorithm
- Hint system for step-by-step assistance
- Modern UI with visual feedback
- Error handling and validation messages

## Technical Approach

### Data Structure
- The Sudoku grid is represented as a 9x9 2D array
- Empty cells are represented by empty strings in input state and 0s during solving
- The grid state is managed using React's useState hook

### Validation Logic
The application implements three levels of validation:

1. **Input Validation**
   - Only accepts numbers 1-9 or empty cells
   - Real-time validation during user input
   - Prevents invalid character entry

2. **Grid Validation**
   - Checks for duplicate numbers in:
     - Each row
     - Each column
     - Each 3x3 sub-grid
   - Validates before solving attempt
   - Provides immediate feedback on invalid configurations

3. **Solution Validation**
   - Ensures proposed solutions meet all Sudoku rules
   - Validates completeness of solution

### Solving Algorithm

The solver uses a backtracking algorithm with the following approach:

1. **Find Empty Cell**
   - Scans the grid left-to-right, top-to-bottom
   - Identifies first empty cell (value 0)

2. **Try Numbers**
   - For each empty cell, try numbers 1-9
   - Check if number is valid in current position
   - If valid, place number and recursively try to solve remaining cells
   - If invalid or leads to unsolvable puzzle, backtrack and try next number

3. **Backtracking Process**
   ```
   If no empty cells remain:
       Return true (puzzle solved)
   Find next empty cell
   For numbers 1 to 9:
       If number is valid in current cell:
           Place number
           Recursively solve remaining puzzle
           If solution found:
               Return true
           If no solution found:
               Reset cell to 0 (backtrack)
   Return false (no valid solution)
   ```

### Hint System

The hint system uses a modified version of the solving algorithm:

1. Find first empty cell
2. Try each possible number
3. Attempt to solve puzzle with that number
4. If solvable, use that number as a hint
5. Provides progressive assistance without immediately solving the puzzle

## UI/UX Considerations

- Grid visualization
  - Clear separation of 3x3 sub-grids with thicker borders
  - Visual feedback for solved state (green background)
  - Responsive input cells
  
- User feedback
  - Error messages for invalid configurations
  - Success indication when puzzle is solved
  - Interactive buttons with clear purposes

## Dependencies

- React
- shadcn/ui components (Button, Alert)
- Lucide React (for icons)

## Running the Project

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

2. Install required shadcn/ui components:
```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button alert
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Usage

1. Input initial Sudoku values in the grid
2. Click "Validate" to check if the current configuration is valid
3. Click "Solve" to find a solution
4. Use "Hint" for step-by-step assistance
5. Click "Clear" to reset the grid

## Performance Considerations

- The backtracking algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(9^(n*n)) where n is the grid size
- Input validation is optimized to check only affected row, column, and sub-grid
- State updates are batched for better performance
- Memoization can be added for larger puzzles if needed

## Future Enhancements

- Multiple solution detection and display
- Difficulty rating for puzzles
- Puzzle generator
- Save/load puzzle configurations
- Step-by-step solution visualization
- Mobile-responsive design improvements
